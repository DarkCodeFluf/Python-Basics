A Trashcan of some* of the Python projects that I've worked on.
Please keep in mind that I have only started learning Python. 

- guessing_game :
The Player is asked to guess a random number that the computer "is thinking of".
There are 3 levels of difficulty:
- Easy. Guess a number from 0 to 50, with a lot of guess attempts. (9999)
- Normal. Guess a number from 0 to 100, with 30 guess attempts.
- Hard. Guess a number from 0 to 100, with only 10 guess attempts.
The project includes input validation, as well as input feedback.
